## URL SHORTNER PROJECT
This project is a url shortner project I made to while learning with Rust and Axum. Like most url shortners, it takes a long url and returns a short url that redirects to the long url. 

### Stack used:
- Rust
- Axum
- Docker
- Postgres
- SQLX

### Todo:
- [x] Create a basic url shortner webapp for this project
- [x] It should have a stats endpoint that returns the number of times the short url has been visited.
